# Contributing to Nodify

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 👍🎉

The best contribution of all is to give this project a ⭐ **star** ⭐. I've spent days and nights working on this and I'm giving it all for **free**. ❤️

Ok, enough of me crying... You decided to contribute to this project, right?

Well.. cool, but hold on, we're nice people here.
So if you want to join the ***nicest*** of the ***nice*** programmers, then you are expected to uphold the [Nodify Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). *(don't even waste time reading it, it's common sense 😎)*

## TL;DR

- Create a pull request linking to a [bug](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/bug)
- Create a [feature](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/enhancement) request
- Create an [example application](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/tree/master/Examples)
- Help with the [documentation](https://miroiu.github.io/nodify/docs)
- Write clear and descriptive issues and try to avoid duplication

## How Can I Contribute?

Well, you can either report and fix bugs, suggest or implement features and example applications, improve the documentation or write tests.

### 🐛 Reporting and fixing bugs

Did you find any? I'm pretty sure there are no bugs because there are no failing tests. Oh wait, there are **no** tests at all. But seriously now... if you find any:

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/bug) as the bug might have been already reported.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible by filling in [the required template](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D).
> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### ⚰️ No bug can live forever

So you fixed a bug, huh? Cool, create a pull request and link the issue describing the bug. I'm pretty sure you'll make someone happy. (at least I will be happy 😊)

### 🧪 Writing tests

Hmm.. a though one. I never wrote tests for custom controls and I have no idea on how to do that nor have the time to do it.

**Buuuut** if you know what you're doing, and I'm pretty sure you do 🙂, then please [create an issue](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=question&template=ask-a-question.md&title=%5BQuestion%5D) and let's have a discussion about this.

### 🌺 Suggesting Enhancements

So you have a beautiful idea and you think nobody thought of this (*laughing out loud*) and it would be generally useful, then you must be aware that:

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/enhancement) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the required template](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you suggested but missing important features, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### ✨ Implementing a simple example application

If you want to create an example application that others can use to learn from, then [create an issue](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=application&template=add_example_app.md&title=%5BApplication%5D) describing what your application is doing and if you need help with anything.

### 📖 Improving Documentation

Ah.. nobody got time for that, but someone has to do it. Documentation is lacking at the moment. So any contributions to it are highly appreciated.

If you find that something is not clear or missing from the documentation, please [create an issue](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=documentation&template=documentation.md&title=%5BDocs%5D).

The easiest way to update documentation is to navigate [here](https://miroiu.github.io/nodify/docs/) and click 'Edit this page' which is found at the bottom of any page.

### 🎉 Showcase your application

Great! You created an awesome application using Nodify and decided to show it to the world. Navigate to the [showcase page](https://miroiu.github.io/nodify/showcase/) and submit your creation!

> **Note**: Your application can use any license.
