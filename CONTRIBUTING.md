# Contributing to Nodify

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 👍🎉

The best contribution of all is to give this project a ⭐ **star** ⭐. I've spent countless days and nights working on this and I'm giving it all for **free**. ❤️

Ok, enough of me crying... You decided to contribute to this project, right? **RIGHT???**

Well.. cool, but hold on, we're nice people here, right? **RIGHT???**

So if you want to join the ***nicest*** of the ***nice*** programmers, then you are expected to uphold the [Nodify Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). *(don't even waste time reading it, it's common sense 😎)*

## TL;DR

- Create a pull request linking to a [bug](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/bug)
- Create a [feature](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/enhancement) request
- Help with the [documentation](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/wiki)
- Write clear and descriptive issues and try to avoid duplication

## How Can I Contribute?

Well, you can either report and fix bugs, suggest or implement features, improve the documentation or write tests.

### 🐛 Reporting and fixing bugs

Did you find any? I'm pretty sure there are no bugs because there are no failing tests. Oh wait, there are **no** tests at all. But seriously now... if you find any:

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/bug) as the bug might have been already reported.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible by filling in [the required template](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### ⚰️ No bug can live forever

So you fixed a bug, huh? Cool, create a pull request and link the issue describing the bug. I'm pretty sure you'll make someone happy. (at least I will be happy 😊)

### 🧪 Writing tests

Hmm.. a though one. I never wrote tests for custom controls and I have no idea on how to do that nor have the time to do it.

**Buuuut** if you know what you're doing, and I'm pretty sure you do 🙂, then please create an issue and let's have a discussion about this.

### 🌺 Suggesting Enhancements

So you have a beautiful idea and you think nobody thought of this (*laughing out loud*) and it would be generally useful, then you must be aware that:

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/labels/enhancement) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the required template](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you suggested but missing important features, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### ✨ Implementing your dream feature

If you already suggested an enchancement and wrote some code for it, create a pull request linking to the existing enhancement.

### 📖 Improving Documentation

Ah.. nobody got time for that, but someone has to do it. Documentation is lacking at the moment. So any contributions to it are highly appreciated.

## 📝 General guidelines
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the bug or suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the bug or suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Make sure the bug or suggestion is not already reported.
